    <h2 class="timeline__title">Challenge 1 - Scavenger Hunt</h2>
    <p class="timeline__paragraph">
      This was the first challenge we had as a ThinkTank. It was a scavenger hunt around the campus were we had to take pictures as at every answer to a clue given. We had five phrases that we had to unravel to find the answer and then hed to the part of the school were that answer lay and take a picture next to it. The challenge was an exercise activity for both our minds and bodies. From the endless running to and from different clues to the problem-solving skills we each incorporated in order to find the answers, this challenge was a good bonding activity for us.

    <p class="timeline__paragraph">
      We were tasked to create a short story about an African Country of our choice highlighting a particular area and how it will look like in the next 35 years. We chose to work on food security in Zimbabwe highlighting the impact that the government of Zimbabwe, led at the time by former President Robert Mugabe, had in the early 2000's in redistributing land from the white farmers to the indigenous black people and how currently a new crop of young farmers is emerging and the future looks promising making food security in the next 35 years look promising for Zimbabwe.

    <p class="timeline__paragraph">
      We were tasked to make a slide deck to that will be used to fight against child malnutrition in a community and include a call to action. From this we learnt the importance of dividing and delegating the workload to make it simpler and faster because we divided the slide deck into different portions and everyone had a part to work on. We also managed to come up with a trivia game  that helps you get smarter while making a difference for people in Rwanda. Every question you answer correctly raises money to end malnutrition in Rwanda. Private sponsors match the right answers to donations generated within the game.

    <p class="timeline__paragraph">
     We were given a budget of 1$ to set off a chain of impact needed to solve our problem as a ThinkTank while incorporating our strengths. We decided to make a "Take what you need, Give what you can" board as a way of directly interacting with the students using different forms of Art, teaching them that Art therapy does not need them to visit a therapist to talk about their mental health but it could be in the simplest things like listening to a song that gets you dancing into a happy mood. We  also decided to make an online anonymous chat space for people to interact with each other and share different ways they have used art to cope with their mental health and for them to advise one another on different mental health issues.
